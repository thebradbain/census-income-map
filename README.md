# Median Household Income of California
This app visulizes the median household income of California according to geographic location where census tract data is available. The project was inspired from both my politics and computer science assignments in school. The code behind this project is currently available to view and edit on my GitHub.

Technologies this visualization is built upon are Vue.js for the frontend, Sails.js for the backend, Grunt for packaging and distribution, and Postgres and Redis for the database and census query upload service, respectively.

## Credit
Credit to The United States Census Bureau for publishing their data in addition to providing an open-source sdk to access it all, CitySDK.

Also credit to Leaflet, Mapbox, and OpenStreetMap for providing the mapping tools to make this visualization possible.
